Rev 1
=====

Replaced R3 from 12 Ohm to 50ohm. Otherwise I was seeing high frequency
oscillations when the RV1 trimpot was turned down.

Rev 2
=====
Changed C45 from 22nF to 2200pF to increase the piezo gain on board 1.
Changed it to 4700pF when I realized that was too much gain for the piezo stage.

Rev 3
=====
Changed R28 and R29 from 2k to 1k, to allow enough current through the zener
diodes for breakdown.

On board 2, replaced the LT1028 opamps with the OP211. OP211 has comparable
noise and GBW specs as LT1028, but offers rail to rail swing. When I tested
out the OP211, it wasn't oscillating when the voltage hit the rails, as LT1028
was. Also, there are no issues with oscillations in the derivative gain stage
on the second opamp.

Replaced LT1028 with OPA211 on board 1 as well.
