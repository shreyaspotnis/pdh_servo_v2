Improvements
============

- Swap amplifier for one with higher GBP. OPA211 seems like a good choice.
Lower noise, higher bandwidth.
- Two stage amplifier needed, since we need to invert the signal so that
the sign is the same as the direct RF path.
- Phase lead on the second stage amplifier.
- Switches for I gain.
- Possibility to monitor multiple signals:
   - Input error monitor, as is and low pass filtered. Low pass filtered version
   is useful for discerning features on an oscilloscope that could have been
   obscured due to noise. Should I include input error + offset? Maybe
   can switch to output error monitor for that.
   - Output error monitor
   - Piezo monitor
   - Transmitted PD monitor
- Feedforward to current.
- Trimpot for external modulation.
- Power supply filtering
- Smart relocking
- Onboard arduino for relocking logic
- Single turn trimpots for gain adjustment
- Multiple turn trimpots for offset adjustment
- On board capacitance multiplier


Maybes
======
- Put scanning signal in the box itself.
- Let the arduino generate the scan signal.
- Digital panel meter, optionally use the microcontroller.


Component choices
=================
- Amplifier: OPA211 seems to be a good choice. Low input voltage and current
noise, and 50 MHZ GBP. Using the OPA2211 dual amplifier. Has the same pin
configuration as the OP27 I have used previously.
- muController: The particle photon microcontroller seems like a good choice.
We do not need this to be extremely fast. This can transfer data over wifi,
so easy to program, and is quite cheap.
Okay, so setting the photon was incredibly easy.


- Switches: fox uses 100ns, 100pA switches, I'm using DG444.
- DIP switches: http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/copal-electronics-inc/CJS-1200TB/563-1022-2-ND/948333
- single turn trimpots

Design choices
==============
A number of analog switches will be placed in the servo loop filter to
aid in switching integrators and signal inputs. I'm basing the design on the
Fox et. al design (pg 24 on http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/1819.pdf). The
servo has a number of switches:

- S1 - servo input switch. Turns off the input signal to the servo electronics.
- S2 - input offset switch. Turns off the input offset trimpot signal.
- S3 - stage 1 integrator switch
- S4 - piezo input switch
- S5 - piezo integrator switch
- S6 - current servo output switch

We don't need S2, as that switch is always on. Similarly, S6 will always be on.
Instead we will add an external piezo scan switch.

Notation: if a switch is "on" or "closed" or 1, it allows current to flow.

Here's the control algorithm:

- Initial locking phase:
011010
The laser is swept through the cavity, while the current and piezo feedback is off.
- When cavity transmission is detected:
111110
Turn on servo input and piezo input.
- Check transmission. If still high, lock has been acquired. Turn on piezo
integrator.
- If transmission high, this worked.
Turn current integrator.


Currently, here's what I do to reqacquire lock:
- Turn off integrator.
- Turn on external piezo scan. If laser is still within the scanning range,
then great. There will be transmission again, and I can acquire lock again.


- Manual Switch
http://www.digikey.ca/product-search/en?keywords=100SP3T2B4M7RE
switch has three positions:
top: 2 pin connected to 1  (take this as ON)
bottom: 2 connected to 3 (take this as OFF)
mid: 2 open

- Doing a double BNC connector. Much better

A is bottom. Remember
